# 🚀 Java Daily Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Java Practice Vault** – a growing collection of Java programs, created and uploaded daily as part of my journey to master Java fundamentals, problem-solving, and real-world applications.

## 📁 What's Inside?

This repository contains:

- 📌 **Beginner to Advanced Java Programs**
- 🔁 Daily uploads of new `.java` files
- 📚 Code organized by topics, concepts, or challenges
- 🧠 Problem-solving techniques and logic building

## 💡 Why This Repo?

I'm using this space as:

- 🧪 A personal lab to experiment with Java
- 📖 A revision library for future reference
- 🎯 A tracker for consistent daily coding

## 📅 Update Schedule

> **New Java files will be added every day!**  
Each file is named meaningfully to reflect its purpose or the concept it covers.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Java (JDK 17/21)** – All code is written using modern Java syntax.
- Optional: Code is tested locally via IDEs like IntelliJ or VS Code.

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Add README comments to each file
- Group files into subfolders (e.g., `OOP`, `DSA`, `Patterns`)
- Include problem statements for each code snippet

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal project, but if you spot improvements or want to collaborate, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
